# Primecheck

I was curious about the prime counting function and the distribution of primes.
the growth of π(x) is apparently n/log(n), or very close to it. I guess that
means the distribution of primes at x, say πd(x), is asymptotic to 1 or 0. But
I'm not sure.

This is really a useless program. Just a fun little diddy.
